# Facial Emotion Classifier from Facial Expression using Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Network

I developed a program to recognize four (happy, angry, sad, surprised) human facial expressions from a picture.
This project won	4th place at Southeastern CCSC (Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges).

To run this program you will need: keras, numpy, cv2, matplotlib
